# Mapping Clone using Python

This is a map type program that used OSMnx to create a path from your location to the nearest hospital. This was built to implement Dijkstra shortest path in a real world context. We could have used existing methods 
to find the shortest path betwee nodes but we did this mannually and extracted data from graph objects to achieve this. 

### Running this project
OSMnx library is needed to run this project.
